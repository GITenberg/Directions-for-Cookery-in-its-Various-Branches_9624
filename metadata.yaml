description: Written by Eliza Leslie, or Miss Leslie as she was commonly called, Directions
  for Cookery was undoubtedly the most popular cookbook in the 19th century. Published
  in 1837 in Philadelphia, this clear, concise, and elegant cookbook emphasized the
  nuances of good cooking, the importance of specific measurements&mdash;not always
  a common practice at that time&mdash;and the significance of good ingredients to
  prepare the best food in the kitchen. Directions for Cookery is surely an American
  classic. With recipes for Beef-Steak Pudding, Moravian Sugar Cakes, Cat-Fish Soup,
  Johnny Cake, Indian Pudding, Molasses Candy, New York Cookies, Pumpkin Chips, Tomato
  Catchup, and Election Cake, Directions for Cookery sparks your appetite and makes
  this classic culinary work an invaluable addition to any kitchen. This edition of
  Directions for Cookery was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection
  of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1812 by
  Isaiah Thomas, a Revolutionary War patriot and successful printer and publisher,
  the society is a research library documenting the lives of Americans from the colonial
  era through 1876. The society collects, preserves, and makes available as complete
  a record as possible of the printed materials from the early American experience.
  The cookbook collection comprises approximately 1,100 volumes.
